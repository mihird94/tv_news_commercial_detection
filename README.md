# tv_news_commercial_detection
This is the project repository for the semester project in Big Data and Analytics course


This project uses pySpark to build a clasifier to classify a TV news channel frame as either Commercial or Non-Commercial, based on a set of Audio Visual Features.

- Goal is to automatic identiÔ¨Åcation and extraction of commercial blocks in telecast news videos
- Extraction of commercials is an important preprocessing step in broadcast media analysis, and evaluation of video analysis is crucial for competitive marketing analysis and advertising planning
- News channels do not follow any particular news presentation format, have large variability and dynamic nature
- Hence, automatic identification of commercial blocks using machine learning approaches provides a viable alternative
